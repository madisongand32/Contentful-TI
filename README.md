# Contentful-TI

A repository for maintaining clean, source-of-truth HTML used in the Learning Center on Thought Industries (TI).

TIâ€™s text editor often auto-corrects or alters code, which can disrupt CSS styling and HTML structure. These files serve as a stable reference to preserve the original layout and design.

# How to Use

When making updates in TI, also update the relevant files in this repo. This ensures we always have a reliable version of the original code in case anything needs to be restored.

# Folder Structure

Folders are organized by page, with sub-folders for each section.

HTML files correspond to specific sections within each page.

Note:
Most files are divided by comments to reflect TIâ€™s column-based widgets.

To use this code in TI:

- Copy each section individually.
- Paste it into the correct text box using the HTML (</>) editor option.

# Styling Notes

Some styles may appear incorrect in TIâ€™s editor view (but look fine on the live site) due to Tailwind CSS usage.
